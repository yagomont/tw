# How To Contribute To Our Projects

Here at *Fully Toasted* we are striving to form and grow a professional in-house development team with a strong focus on professionalism. We are aiming to develop plugins, mods, and other software within the sphere of gaming, all of which can be both commercially viable and quality products that are of interest and support to our community and others. As well as help out, not just our community but our team members, to further grow together. If you are at all interested in joining our community's development team please follow the steps outlined below:

1. [Apply](https://fullytoasted.world/help-us-grow/apply-to-help/) to our community's development team.
2. Reach out to our CEO, Toast, on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rRndTtU) and open the dialogue.
3. Schedule an interview with our CEO, Toast, and our development team lead, Ava.
4. If you're accepted onto the team all developers are required to sign a one year non-disclosure and non-competition agreement.
5. After these steps you'll be brought into our Discord based team discussions, pointed to our internal documentation, assigned/offered development tasks, and begin work with our team.
